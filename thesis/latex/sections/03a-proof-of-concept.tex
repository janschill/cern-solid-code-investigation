\section{Proof of Concepts}

One central part of the investigation into the CERN-Solid collaboration is the development of a \gls{poc}. The \gls{poc} contains the creation of two independent software modules in an existing system from \gls{cern}. These software modules should show how to develop with the Solid principles in mind and to the Solid standard.

The goal of these modules is the symbiosis of decentralized stored data in a highly functional system without comprising its \textit{Performance}, \textit{Security}, or \textit{Usability}.
