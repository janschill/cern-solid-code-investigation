\section{Proof of Concepts}

One main part of the investigation into the CERN-Solid collaboration is the development of a \gls{poc}. The \gls{poc} contains the creation of two independent software modules in an existing system from \gls{cern}. These software modules should show how it is to develop with the Solid principles in mind and to the Solid standard.

The goal of these modules is the symbiosis of decentralized stored data in a highly functional system without comprising its performance, security, or usability.

\subsection{POC 1: Commenting Module for Events in Indico}

The first \gls{poc} is supposed to enrich the Indico system with some sort of Solid-based content. With the product owner and chief developer of Indico, the CERN-Solid project manager and a Solid developer it was decided a commenting module for Indico events is an adequate solution to include data from an external storage entity namely a data pod. The ability to allow users of Indico to leave a comment on an event, which then lives in a data pod completely controlled by the author of the comment was concluded to be an attractive feature for Indico.

    \caption{User interface showing the comment module.}
    \label{fig:indico-comments-screen_design}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Design}\mbox{}\\

For the implementation of this module several design decisions had to be made. From the fundamental choice of the module running on the client device or be computed on the server and then propagated to the client afterwards or even with a microservice proxying all traffic through it to enable Solid without changing Indico.
Other design challenges were around how to protect the resources holding the comment information. These resources reside on the external data pod and need to be fetched from the application and read by other agents. Can \glspl{acl} be configured to allow the specific use-case?

\paragraph{Client- versus Server-Side versus Microservice}\mbox{}\\

When an agent browses to a running instance of Indico most of the functionality is being prepared on the server hosting Indico. It retrieves the specific request, builds the \gls{html}, and sends it to the user. For Indico most of the functionality is built with Python and the web framework Flask. Sometimes functionality needs to be closer to the user, an example is dynamic rendering of \gls{dom} elements. This is useful when new data needs to be shown right away without getting the blank white screen on a page reload.
Indico does send JavaScript, which is used for client-side features, but it focuses on keeping most its features on the server.

To make the right decision if the module should be primarily developed for the client- or server-side or even as a microservice, a list of requirements to the module had to be defined. With the defined requirements in place it had to be figured out how much functionality can be extracted from existing libraries and how much needed to be implemented with the new module. Implementing existing functionality for a new programming language would defeat the \gls{poc}’s purpose of showing how an existing software could work with the Solid principles.

The rudimentary set of features to enable commenting for users in Indico while saving the data in a data pod includes: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Authentication with a Solid \gls{idp}
    \item (Authenticated) Requests to a data pod
    \item Parsing of structured data (Linked Data)
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Client Approach}\mbox{}\\

The module runs in the browser and is therefore written in JavaScript. A programming language which compiles to JavaScript, such as TypeScript, is also possible. This means Indico remains mostly untouched, but would have to serve the needed JavaScript to the client on traffic to an event endpoint where the comment module is integrated.

    \end{tabular}
    \vspace{0.75cm}
    \caption{Existing solutions to problems for a client approach.}
    \label{table:1}
\end{table}

The communication flow with the data pod and the module would happen primarily from the browser.

    \caption{Communication flow for a module developed on the client.}
    \label{fig:poc-infrastructure-frontend}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Microservice Approach}\mbox{}\\

The microservice approach would allow developing the needed Solid logic on a separate service, which proxies all Solid related traffic through it an enable the Solid functionality. Most of the libraries from the client implementation can be used as well, as both developments would be written in JavaScript. Only the authentication flow would work a bit different.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{| l | l |} 
    \hline
     Problem & Solution \\
     \hline
      Language & JavaScript or TypeScript  \\

    \end{tabular}
    \vspace{0.75cm}
    \caption{Existing solutions to problems for a microservice approach.}
    \label{table:2}
\end{table}

The microservice module would handle take all requests aimed at the data pod and make it compliant with the Solid server. It would provide the client with the proper \gls{solidoidc} flow to attach the access token to all authenticated requests.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{prototype/graphs/poc-infrastructure-microservice.jpeg}
    \caption{Communication flow for a module developed as a microservice.}
    \label{fig:poc-infrastructure-microservice}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Server Approach}\mbox{}\\

Goal of the server approach would be just like with the microservice approach to decouple the logic needed to work with Solid from the client and have it run on a server instance. The attractiveness for the server approach would be it could be fully integrated within Indico and be part of its Python code base. The major drawbacks are no direct Solid libraries written in Python exist to allow a seamless integration into the ecosystem.

    \begin{tabular}{| l | l |} 
    \hline
     Problem & Solution \\
     \hline

    \end{tabular}
    \vspace{0.75cm}
    \caption{Existing solutions to problems for a server approach.}
    \label{table:3}
\end{table}

The authentication library pyoidc allows authenticating with \gls{oidc} systems, but is missing a mandatory feature called \gls{dpop}, which is needed to make requests to protected resources on a data pod.

\paragraph{Comparison of the Different Approaches}\mbox{}\\

Benefits from developing the module for the client:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Necessary libraries exist (Major release for all basic Solid flows exist)
    \item Community support
    \item Programming effort for an \gls{mvp} lowest
    \item Documentation on developing Solid apps in JavaScript exist

\paragraph{Single versus Multiple Resource(s) for Comments}

Storing the comments in \gls{rdf} can be done in two ways: storing it in one file as a graph with a list of comments, or creating a file for every comment.

    \caption{Communication flow for a module developed as a microservice.}
    \label{fig:poc-infrastructure-microservice}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Protection on Resource}\mbox{}\\

Every container and resource in Solid is protected with \gls{wac}, which determines if specific agents, groups, or the world can have read, write, append, or control access. These control access modes are defined in \gls{acl} files. The Solid \gls{acl} inheritance algorithm looks for an \gls{acl} file attached to a specific resource, if it cannot find one it goes recursively up the file hierarchy and looks for \glspl{acl} on the containers.
Indico allows two general types of protection \textit{private} and \textit{public} on its events. Public means open to everyone, no Indico account or any type of authorization is needed to see the event. Whereas private can be as fine-grained as only to specific agents or groups. A comment module is only valuable if the comments can be read by anyone and be written by authorized users.

In order for visitors of a private or public event in Indico to be able to see the comment, the comment’s \gls{acl} needs to allow the public to read the resource. This can be achieved by using the \textit{public} container, which comes with public-read by default on the \gls{nss} or by creating a new container and setting the \gls{acl} with:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Other,columns=fullflexible, caption={TODO: Label caption}, label={lst:1}]
@prefix acl: <http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#>.
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>.

# ... Definition for owner

<#example-container-name>
    a acl:Authorization;
    acl:agentClass foaf:Agent;
    acl:accessTo <./>;
    acl:mode acl:Read.
\end{lstlisting}

Every resource in this container is by definition readable by the public -- if not otherwise stated in a more detailed resource \gls{acl}. The above definition even allows the reading of the container’s content, meaning a request to the container would yield a list of resources in the container. This becomes unpleasant if the Indico event is private and the comments for this Indico event should not be read by the world, which is entirely possible, when browsing to the location of a specific data pod and then looking into the public container.

To prevent a random agent to see the contents of a container, the container can be set to private, with the container’s resources to still be public. This would allow everyone provided they have the \gls{url} to browse to the public resource and read it, but not look into the resource’s parent container. To achieve this behavior with \gls{acl}, the container needs to just define its owner and no specific rules for the public, as \gls{wac} comes with a default private access control. Each child resource needs to define an \gls{acl} now, allowing public read.
The container’s \gls{acl} would look like the following with just a owner defined:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Other,columns=fullflexible, caption={TODO: Label caption}, label={lst:2}]
@prefix acl: <http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#>.

<#owner>
    a acl:Authorization;
    acl:agent <https://janschill.net/profile/card#me>;
    acl:accessTo <./>;
    acl:default <./>;
    acl:mode acl:Read, acl:Write, acl:Control.
\end{lstlisting}

A child resource would allow public read with:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Other,columns=fullflexible, caption={TODO: Label caption}, label={lst:3}]
@prefix : <#>.
@prefix acl: <http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#>.
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>.

# ... Definition for owner

:Read
    a acl:Authorization;
    acl:accessTo <test.txt>;
    acl:agentClass foaf:Agent;
    acl:mode n0:Read.
\end{lstlisting}

Another approach and the one implemented after iterating through the previous ones is to have the container’s \gls{acl} resource define a default access mode for its child resources. This way one \gls{acl} only needs to be created on the container and all resources have proper access modes for public read and are not listed publicly in the container’s description.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Other,columns=fullflexible, caption={TODO: Label caption}, label={lst:4}]
@prefix acl: <http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#>.
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>.
@prefix target: <./>.

:ReadDefault
    a acl:Authorization;
    acl:default target:;
    acl:agentClass foaf:Agent;
    acl:mode acl:Read.
\end{lstlisting}
